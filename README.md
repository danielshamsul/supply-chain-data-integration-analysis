# Supply Chain Data Integration & Analysis

## Overview
This project integrates and analyzes supply chain datasets to uncover operational insights related to wholesale and retail orders. The goal is to demonstrate data integration, preprocessing, and exploratory analytics for real-world supply chain decision-making.

## Objectives
- Integrate multiple supply chain datasets
- Perform data cleaning and transformation
- Analyze order patterns across wholesale and retail operations
- Generate actionable insights for supply chain optimization

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are publicly available on Kaggle:

1. Supply Chain Analysis Dataset  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis

2. Wholesale and Retail Orders Dataset  
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gabrielsantello/wholesale-and-retail-orders-dataset

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Integration & Cleaning Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Methodology
1. Import multiple supply chain datasets
2. Clean and preprocess data (handling missing values, formatting)
3. Integrate datasets for unified analysis
4. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns
5. Generate insights on order distribution and trends

## Key Insights
- Identified trends in wholesale vs retail order patterns
- Observed variations in supply chain demand across categories
- Demonstrated the value of integrating multiple data sources for better operational visibility
